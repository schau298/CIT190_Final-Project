<ul><h1>About the iSpy Game</h1>
    <p>
    <li>The purpose of the game is to try and find the animal on the farm. The picrture of the animal is shown at the top of the page. The goal is to have the least amount of guesses.</li>
    <li>One current problem is that the user does not necessarily have to restart the game.</li>
    <li>I am currently trying to figure this issue out. An update will be released!</li>
