<ul><h1>About the Bee Game</h1>
    <p>
    <li>The purpose of this game is to help the Bee find his way home. Score as many points as possible by avoiding the obstacles.</li>
    <li>One current problem with this game is that the highschore you get in one round does not save into the next round.</li>
    <li>Plans are currently not in the works to solve this issue and there are also no plans to update the game.</li>
